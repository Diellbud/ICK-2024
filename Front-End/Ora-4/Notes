To use CSS we have 3 methods:
                             Internal (It is its own element)
                             External (Found outside the main File)
                             In-Line  (It is an attribute in elements)
in CSS

<p class="Description" id="Desc">
        Hello
<p/>

.description{
    color:blue
}
Changes the Classes which is named "Description" into the color blue


#desc{
    color:red
}
Changes the Ids which is named "desc" into the color red


p{
    color:Green
}
Changes all of the <p>'s into the color green

Margin moves the outside children
Padding moves the inside children
Box-sizing:"border-box" makes padding and margins respect the width and height previously given

Units:
PX - ni pik ne ekran
EM - (Amount of EMs) * (px i prindit)
REM - (Amount of REMs) * (px i Rootit)
% - Takes up the amount of % of the Roots screen (in real time)
vh - simmilar to % but not in real-time


display: block; acts like a div
display: InLine; acts like a span
display: InLine-block; acts like a span but width and height can be changable
display: None; acts like nothing
visability: hidden; hides element but still keeps its space
